# Java-Projects-Pt.1
The projects featured are all projects I worked on during the first half of my Freshman year


The 4 Main Projects Include:

•	Created Calculator that uses a self-implemented Stack Class operating as a Linked List which takes in string inputs of equations, converts to postfix expression, and then calculates to yield the correct answer. 

•	Handle database info via advanced file manipulation using C++ to append database file and edit, delete data based on user inputs

•	Grading contestant answers based on an answer key file, and then displaying the defining stats of the contestants as a whole, using Smart Pointers and Maps in C++. All data was allocated dynamically to adapt to space constraints, using C++

•	Implemented Custom Linked List Class in C++ in order to take File input and User Input, store data in memory, and redisplay data based on user commands. All data was stored in memory and inputted into the user file recursively.

Also Included are various Side projects, Documentation is provided for all projects in a form of a PDF
